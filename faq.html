IPTV uses a broadband Internet connection for top international programming directly to your home without a satellite dish. Just connect your receiver to your IPTV Internet from the house and on your TV, then sit back and enjoy.</p>
    <h5> <strong> 2 – WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND SATELLITE IPTV PROGRAMMING? </strong></h5>

IPTV offers a unique solution for customers who are unable to satellite programming (due to no sight to the satellite or apartment with its limitations). IPTV provides higher quality and cheaper than traditional satellite service.</p>
    <h5> <strong>3 – WHAT DO I NEED TO LOOK FOR TV? To install and use the IPTV, you need the following:</strong></h5>
    <p class="pt-2">High-speed Internet connection (recommended or higher) at least 4.0 Mbps. A functioning Smart TV , PC , Laptops , MAC , MAG box , Android Box , Smart Phones , Avov box , OpenBOX , Fire Tv stick , Formuler box ETC…. </p>

      <p class="pt-2">Yes, you can buy and use IPTV if you do not qualify for a satellite TV service. Since IPTV delivers international programming to your TV via the Internet, no satellite dish is required. Moreover, To qualify, you need a high-speed internet connection of at least 4.0 Mbps or higher and stable with lower lataenchy (PING) . </p>

        Secondly, if your network connection is no problem, please check whether your account is used on other devices. as you can view from more than 1 device at the same time. Also for testing propose check your connection from different internet provider ( you can install on your smartphone using your mobile internet check installation tutorials in the site if need more help to install ) if you found that your internet service provider blocked connection you must need a VPN connection to bypass that .Good vpn you can find here : NEED VPN</p>
        <h5><strong>8- I AM NOT IN OR FROM USA/CAN OR THE UK. CAN I STILL SUBSCRIBE?</strong></h5>
        <p class="pt-2">Yes. Our service is available worldwide to everyone. Subscribe here.</p>
        <h5><strong>9- CAN I USE MY SUBSCRIPTION ON MULTIPLE DEVICES?</strong></h5>
        <p class="pt-2">Please pay attention that 1 subscription can be used on multiple devices but you can watch only on 1 device at the same time. If you want to connect multiple devices in tehe same time you must purchase multi room package 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 connectioins package . </p>
        <h5><strong>10- WHAT PAYMENT METHODS ARE AVAILABLE?</strong></h5>

          <p>– Check if you entered your activation details correctly.</p>
          <p>– Check your network connection, reboot your router and device, and then try again.</p>
          <p>– If you have PC/Laptop, etc. connected to same internet network check if you are not overloading your network with downloading or watching movies, etc… on these devices.</p>
          <p>– Your Internet needs to be minimum 4 MBps Download and 4 Mbps upload speed this in most of the cases will be enough to watch satisfied , but our recommendation is to have very high internet speed with lan cable connected not Wireless , 100mbps , if is possible to jump to 300-500-1000mbps will be better for you , Most important is that your internet to be stable and to have low lataenchy ping when you run interent test speed , your ping must be lower then 5 usually when you have high ping you will have buffering issues …. it means your internet not stable </p>
          <p>– Reboot your devices and wait for 30 sec before turning them back on (STBs, Android Boxes, Routers, Cable modems)</p>
          <p>– Make sure you are connecting using a LAN (Ethernet) cable to devices and not via Wifi.</p>
          <p>– If your network connection is no problem, please check whether your account is used on other devices.</p>
          <p>– Please visit www.whatismyip.com by using a computer or browser from your device (any) , and send us IP Address you see displayed for restoration.</p>
          <p>– Check if the device/app/program got the latest software and firmware updates.</p>
          <p>– Check the download speed on the actual device that is streaming our service, you may have 50mbs on your computer, but the device could be considerably slower, indicating a problem on your internal network.</p>
          <p>– Check for any high processor demanding applications running in the background that can be stopped, this is very important for low-end devices.</p>
          <p>– Check if your ISP having problems in your area, an excellent site to check this is downdetector.co.uk</p>
          <p>– Try uninstalling and reinstalling your app/program, your activation will not be lost.</p>
          <h5><strong>13- MY CHANNELS ARE NOT WORKING?</strong></h5>
          <p>We strive to provide you with a high level of service at very discounted rates. So please keep this in mind first and foremost.
            If a channel is down, we will do our best to restore that back to service.</p>
          <p class="pt-3">– Stop and give it a couple of minutes. We reboot and swap channels when needed. The channel may be coming back</p>
          <p>– Is this happening on all channels? If it is, you need to check on your end.</p>
          <p>– Reboot your devices and wait for 30 secs before turning them back on (STBs, Android Boxes, Routers, Cable modems)</p>
          <p>– Make sure you are connecting using a LAN (Ethernet) cable to devices and not via Wifi.</p>
          <h5><strong>14- CHANNEL ISSUES?</strong></h5>
          <p>If while you are watching a channel the service appears to have paused, simply select and open another channel, then return to the original channel to see if it is now playing, this can be due to break in transmission for a second, the software will halt under these conditions. You can also use search console of the app you use and type there channel name you wnat to watch and you can paly from there the same channel different sources , because on opur iptv we offer many streaming sources , if one not working well for you  move to another source.</p>
          <h5><strong>15- BUFFERING ON CHANNELS?</strong></h5>
          <p>Sometimes you may experience buffering due to low internet speed or high internet traffic. Check internet test speed and see your lataenchy or ping if is high you’re having internet issues</p>
          <p class="pt-3">Cause:</p>
          <p>The most common cause of buffering is the result of slow internet connection. This may be because of low internet speed or other users hogging the bandwidth in your house. Do you have lots of users in your home? Disconnect them all and try again
            The second reason is that you are using Wi-Fi, which is not suited for watching TV as you need direct (LAN) connection to internet network in order to enjoy smooth watching without interruptions.</p>
            <p class="pt-3">Resolution:</p>
            <p>Directly connect to your router using a LAN (ethernet) cable or to a powerline adaptor.</p>
            <p>If not possible, try moving the box closer to the router.</p>
            <p>Change your WI-FI channel. To avoid interference with nearby devices.</p>
            <p>If you experience buffering press “pause” for 10-15 seconds and resume, most of the time that will eliminate the need to buffer.</p>
            <h5><strong>16- ALL CHANNELS ARE BLANK?</strong></h5>
            <p>If you are using a set-top box such as MAG or AVOV and have just set up your device with our service, you will need to perform a hard reset of your device. Simply power off your device, unplug your power cable and re-plug it in.</p>
            <p class="pt-1">For Kodi, you will need to clear your cache. If unsuccessful, attempt a re-install of Kodi itself.</p>
            <h5><strong>17- SOME CHANNELS ONLY HAS SOUND WITHOUT VIDEO?</strong></h5>
            <p>Because of decoder setting problem, some channels are only having sound without images/video, please do as followings:</p>
            <p>1. Go to Settings in your device/app/program.</p>
            <p>3. Choose Native for the Decoder.</p>
